# TeleCrypt-io flexisip-docker

**Unofficial community build** of the Belledonne Flexisip SIP proxy and the
`flexisip-conference` server, packaged as Docker images on GitHub Container
Registry.

This repository does **not** contain the upstream source. It builds and publishes
two Docker images whose tags track upstream version numbers. The two
upstream components are versioned independently; each component has its own
image and its own version stream.

This is **not** an official Belledonne Communications image. It is a community
build for self-hosting.

## Contract: upstream version = Docker image tag

For every stable release of `flexisip` and `flexisip-conference`, this
repository automatically builds a Docker image whose tag equals the upstream
version, and pushes it to GHCR. A nightly workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-bump.yml`)
monitors both upstream repositories and triggers the build on new releases.

| Upstream | Image | Tag examples |
|---|---|---|
| `flexisip` | `ghcr.io/telecrypt-io/flexisip-proxy` | `2.6.0`, `latest` |
| `flexisip-conference` | `ghcr.io/telecrypt-io/flexisip-conference` | `1.0.0`, `latest` |

The versioned tag is the primary deliverable. `:latest` is a convenience alias
that always points to the most recently published version.

## What's in the box

Two Docker images:

- **`flexisip-proxy`** — SIP proxy. Owns the TLS port (5061). Manages user
  registration and SIP routing.
- **`flexisip-conference`** — Conference server. Handles group chat and
  audio/video conferences. Includes the EKT plugin (`linphone_ektserver.so`)
  so that conferences can be end-to-end encrypted when configured.

Both images are based on `ubuntu:24.04` and install the Belledonne `.deb`
packages built from upstream source by this repository's CI.

## Automatic TLS via Let's Encrypt IP certificates

The deployment includes an **ACME sidecar** (`goacme/lego`) that automatically
fetches and renews a Let's Encrypt **IP-address TLS certificate** using the
HTTP-01 challenge.

**How it works:**

1. The `acme` container starts and requests a certificate for your public IP
   from Let's Encrypt via HTTP-01 (port 80).
2. The certificate (`cert.pem`) and private key (`privkey.pem`) are written
   into a shared Docker volume (`flexisip_certs`).
3. The `proxy` container mounts this volume at `/etc/flexisip/tls/` (read-only)
   and auto-reloads the certificates every 60 seconds.
4. The ACME container runs a renewal loop every 12 hours, checking if renewal
   is needed (certs are renewed when <3 days remain).

**Requirements:**

- **Port 80/tcp** must be reachable from the Internet on your `SIP_IP`
  (HTTP-01 challenge validation).
- Let's Encrypt issues IP certs as **short-lived certificates** (~6 days).
  Renewal is fully automatic — no manual intervention needed.

**No DNS required.** This solution uses IP-address certificates, so you don't
need a domain name or DNS API access.

## End-to-end encryption (on by default)

E2EE group conferences are **enabled by default**. `config/flexisip-conference.conf`
ships the conference server in **SFU mode** with ZRTP media encryption:

```ini
[conference-server]
audio-engine-mode=sfu
video-engine-mode=sfu
encryption=zrtp
```

These three lines switch the conference to **SFU mode** (server only forwards
RTP packets and rewrites headers, no decode/encode), which is what makes E2EE
possible. The EKT plugin (always installed) distributes encryption keys. **The
conference entrypoint does NOT rewrite this file** — what you see is what runs.
`ENABLE_EKT_SERVER=true` in `.env` is retained only as an intent signal.

To DISABLE E2EE, comment out the three lines above (media then travels
unencrypted and flexisip raises no error — verify after changing).

**EKT plugin license:** The EKT server plugin is provided by **Belledonne
Communications** under the terms described in the upstream
`ENABLE_EKT_SERVER` CMake option. For customers under a proprietary license,
this functionality requires a specific license from Belledonne Communications.
For AGPLv3 self-hosting (which this repository is built for), the plugin is
freely usable. See `NOTICE` for the full attribution and `SECURITY.md` for
verification steps.

## Configuration model (local configs)

This project ships **ready-to-use configuration files** under `config/`. They are
**local files** — mounted from the host into the containers — and are *meant* to be
edited on your server. The repository provides sensible, E2EE-capable defaults; the
only mandatory local change is substituting your public IP for the `<SIP_IP>`
placeholder (and setting real credentials in `config/users.conf`).

**IP and domain management stays local by design.** The images do **not** inject or
rewrite config values at runtime (no in-container `<SIP_IP>` substitution was adopted —
configs are local by design, and that is intentional). This keeps deployments
reproducible and puts your addressing under your own control. Treat
`config/flexisip.conf`, `config/flexisip-conference.conf`, and `config/users.conf` as
files you own.

Environment-only settings live in `.env`: `SIP_IP` (used by the ACME sidecar and the
containers), TURN credentials, and `ENABLE_EKT_SERVER`.

## Quick start

> ⚠️ **Do NOT clone this repo onto your deployment server — copy the files.**
> You edit config files in place on the server, so a clone leaves real
> secrets (TURN credentials, HA1 hashes) in a working tree attached to a
> remote pointing at this **public** repo — one `git commit -a && git push`
> from publishing them. `.env` and `config/users.conf` are untracked and
> gitignored, which removes the main hazard, but copy-don't-clone remains
> the rule. Details and a middle path in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

```bash
# 1. Get the files onto the server WITHOUT cloning.
#    Download a tarball and extract only what you need:
curl -fsSL https://github.com/TeleCrypt-io/flexisip-docker/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz \
  | tar xz --strip-components=1 \
      flexisip-docker-main/docker-compose.yml \
      flexisip-docker-main/versions.env \
      flexisip-docker-main/config \
      flexisip-docker-main/.env.example
#    (If you do clone for convenience, immediately: git remote remove origin)

# 2. Create your live credential files from the examples.
#    These two are gitignored and must NEVER be committed anywhere.
cp .env.example .env
cp config/users.conf.example config/users.conf
chmod 600 .env config/users.conf

# 3. Edit the local config files
# These are local files you own — mounted from the host into the containers.
# Replace <SIP_IP> with your server's public IP in:
#   config/flexisip.conf
#   config/flexisip-conference.conf
#   config/users.conf   (also set real SIP credentials — format below)
# NOTE: config/domain-registrations.conf is already provided (empty) — leave it.
#
# users.conf format (NO comments allowed — Flexisip rejects # anywhere):
#   version:1
#   <user>@<domain> <algo>:<password> ;
# Supported algorithms: clrtxt, md5, sha256. The " ;" terminator is mandatory.
# Example:  version:1\n  test@203.0.113.10 clrtxt:test1234 ;

# 4. Edit .env (created from .env.example in step 2)
# Set SIP_IP, TURN credentials

# 5. Pull and start (port 80 must be reachable for ACME challenge)
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f acme proxy conference
```

The ACME sidecar will automatically obtain a TLS certificate on first start.
The proxy will begin serving SIP over TLS once the certificate is available
(usually within 30-60 seconds).

E2EE is already enabled in `config/flexisip-conference.conf`. `ENABLE_EKT_SERVER=true`
in `.env` is kept as an intent signal (it no longer triggers any runtime change):

```bash
# In .env (intent signal only — E2EE ships in the conference config):
ENABLE_EKT_SERVER=true

# Then:
docker compose up -d
```

## Important configuration notes

- **Transports:** flexisip 2.6 accepts only `sip:` (UDP) and `sips:` (TLS)
  prefixes in `transports`. A `tcp:` prefix crashes the proxy. The proxy is
  configured with `sips:0.0.0.0:5061` (client TLS) and
  **`sip:127.0.0.1:5060`** — the UDP transport is bound to **loopback**,
  because it exists only for the internal hop to the conference server's UDP
  contact. Binding it to `0.0.0.0` would expose an unencrypted SIP transport
  to the Internet. Do not widen it.
- **Conference server is on host networking** (`network_mode: host`). It binds
  `127.0.0.1:6064` and the host-networked proxy reaches it via loopback. Under
  host networking Docker service names don't resolve, so its MariaDB/Redis point
  at `127.0.0.1` (both published on loopback in `docker-compose.yml`) — MariaDB
  is **not** exposed to the Internet.
- **MediaRelay** is enabled (`[module::MediaRelay] enabled=true`). flexisip 2.6
  does not accept `force-relay` / `relay-ips` in that section; the module engages
  automatically on NAT-detected legs.
- **Conference routing is automatic** — the conference server registers its
  factory URI with the proxy's registrar; no proxy route directive is needed
  (an old `conference-factory-uri` key is invalid in v2.6).

## Production considerations

- **E2EE is on by default** — `config/flexisip-conference.conf` ships
  `audio-engine-mode=sfu` + `video-engine-mode=sfu` + `encryption=zrtp`;
  `ENABLE_EKT_SERVER=true` in `.env` is an intent signal only. To turn E2EE off,
  comment those three lines in the conference config (not via `.env`). With E2EE
  off, conferences still work but media is **not** ZRTP-encrypted — and flexisip
  raises **no error**, so E2EE is silently absent. Verify it is active by grepping
  the conference log for:
  `EKT server plugin for core sip:conference-focus@… has been succesfully loaded`.

- **`482 Loop Detected` on client REGISTER — root cause `reg-on-response`:**
  `config/flexisip.conf` sets `reg-on-response=false` (this proxy is the terminal
  registrar). With `true`, the Registrar forwards each REGISTER to the domain's
  next hop; in a single-proxy deployment that next hop is the proxy itself →
  self-forward → `482 Loop Detected` on **every** client REGISTER (not just NATed
  ones). The conference server registers over `127.0.0.1` and slipped past the
  loop check, which masked the bug. **Keep `reg-on-response=false` unless a proxy
  is chained in front.**

- **`482 Loop Detected` on INVITE / forward-loop (upstream issue
  [#187](https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/flexisip/issues/187)):**
  an INVITE from a NATed client whose visible source IP equals the proxy's own
  public IP can be misclassified as a routing loop. Reliable mitigations:
  1. Configure clients with **STUN/TURN** (coturn is included — point the client
     at `stun:<SIP_IP>:3478` / `turn:<SIP_IP>:3478?transport=udp` using the
     `TURN_USER`/`TURN_PASSWORD` from `.env`) so they advertise a
     public/relay Contact.
  2. Keep `aliases=<SIP_IP>` in `[global]` (already set) so the proxy's
     self-identity is unambiguous.
  Test with genuinely remote clients — a same-host netns masquerade that presents
  the server's own IP triggers the false loop and is not representative.

- **Re-register after a proxy restart:** registrar bindings persist in Redis, so
  after `docker restart flexisip-proxy` clients with now-stale bindings may get
  `404`/`482` until they re-register. Restart clients, or use a shorter
  `default-expires` in `[module::Registrar]` during rollout.

- **Conference lifecycle:** finished-conference state is pruned automatically in
  MariaDB. Participant limits are governed by `max-contacts-per-registration`
  (proxy) and the conference server's internal limits — tune for your scale.

- **Monitoring / healthchecks:** compose ships healthchecks for `mariadb`,
  `redis`, `coturn`, `proxy`, and `conference`. Alert on proxy `503`s, TLS cert
  expiry (renewed automatically ~every 6 days by lego), conference-server
  failures, and RTP-relay health.

- **TURN/ICE client example (Linphone):** set the STUN server to
  `stun:<SIP_IP>:3478` and the TURN server to
  `turn:<SIP_IP>:3478?transport=udp` with the credentials from `.env`. This is
  required for clients behind symmetric NAT to establish media.

## Testing notes

- **Use Linphone as the reference client.** `baresip` cannot do group E2EE
  (no LIME/EKT). `linphone-cli` ≥ 5.2 works (native on Ubuntu 24.04).
- **Two clients on one host collide on RTP port 7078** (SO_REUSEPORT). For
  multi-client testing on a single machine, isolate each client in its own
  network namespace, or use separate hosts.
- **Headless servers need an audio source** or RTP/ZRTP never flows. Use a
  pulseaudio null sink (`module-null-sink`) and point clients at it.
- **Let's Encrypt / mbedTLS CA caveat:** mbedTLS-based Linphone clients may
  reject the 2025 Let's Encrypt chain even when `openssl s_client` validates it.
  Do **not** ship `verify_server_certs=0` in production — ensure the client CA
  bundle is current and document the caveat instead.

## How the build works

`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs on push to `main` and on manual trigger.
It has five jobs:

1. **`build-debs`** (bonus) — clones both `flexisip` and `flexisip-conference` at
   the tags in `versions.env`, builds `.deb` packages with `CPACK_GENERATOR=DEB`,
   and publishes them to a GitHub Release.  Runs only when `versions.env` has
   been modified.
2. **`build-proxy-image`** — multi-stage Docker build (`docker/proxy/Dockerfile`).
   Clones the `flexisip` repo and its submodules from upstream source, builds
   the proxy and its dependencies (linphone-sdk, mbedtls, soci, etc.), then
   produces a minimal runtime image pushed to GHCR with both `:<version>` and
   `:latest` tags.
3. **`build-conference-image`** — same for `flexisip-conference`, with
   `-DENABLE_EKT_SERVER=ON` so the EKT plugin is included in the image.
4. **`smoke-test`** — pulls both freshly-built images, inspects their OCI
   labels and entrypoints, and verifies the EKT plugin is present in the
   conference image.
5. **`publish-state`** — on full success, records the built versions in
   `state/built.json`.

`.github/workflows/auto-bump.yml` runs nightly. It queries the GitLab API
for the latest stable tag of each upstream. If a newer version exists that
isn't already in `state/built.json`, it updates `versions.env` and pushes
to `main`, which triggers the build.

`versions.env` is the source of truth for which upstream version is built.
`state/built.json` is the source of truth for which versions have produced
a published image.
